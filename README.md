Weldyn2 Extensions
==================

This is a collection of custom [phpBB][1] extensions used on the official
[Battle for Wesnoth forums][2]. These extensions are designed to work with
phpBB 3.1.10 or later phpBB 3.1.x versions.

Some functionality is still hardcoded in the form of direct modifications to
the phpBB codebase until upstream adds the required functionality for porting
them to the extensions framework. These modifications can be found as part of
the commit history of the [Weldyn2][3] repository.
